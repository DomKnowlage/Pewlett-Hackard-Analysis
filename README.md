# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## OVERVIEW ##
  The esteemed comapny Pewlett-Hackard (PH) has tasked us with combing through their employee data to discover how many employees will be submitting for retirement either now or in the near future. With retirements outpacing hires this aging company is on the verge of a "Silver Tsunami" (dubbed by PH) with our help we can mitigate the damage caused by this event and look for some life rafts in the sea of uncertianty.

  ## RESULTS ##
  * There is going to be a large amount of Senior Engineers retiring
  * Managers are fine only 2 are leaving so far
  * We have over 1500 employees eligible for the mentorship program
  * A lot of the people ready for "mentorship" have been there for years already
  
  ## SUMMARY ##
    Overall I can understand why there were some nerves about the retirements, it's always a bit scary losing some of your top employees after so many years. But some see this as a bad thing my company sees this as a wonerful oppertunity, you have so many employees waiting in the wings, they've put in years at your company so I think it's their time to shine. Get those people trained, move the people under them up so they'll be ready for mentorship and hire some new trainees or full timers. This is the natural cycle of a business, with age comes transformation, you have a lot of bright people ready to lead the charge and train the future of your company. If you stay on the evoloutionary path you'll be albe to stay fresh and bring new ideas to the table for years and years to come.
